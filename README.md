<h1>Adventure Game - Mission Diffuse</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
For this project, I leveraged Java to develop a command-based terminal adventure game featuring interactive characters and rooms, enabling users to input commands that the game processes to trigger responsive actions. The name of my game is “Mission Diffuse”. The player of this game is a bomb disposal specialist who has been sent by their department leader to a hotel where there is a bomber hiding on the rooftop terrace. To win the game, the player must find the bomber and diffuse the bomb. However, the terrace can only be accessed with a key and upon arrival the receptionist can’t find the key at reception. The player is told by the receptionist that the manager has a duplicate key to the terrace. The player must then search the hotel for the manager. When the manager is found, he informs the player that he has left the duplicate key in the pool room, but he also has a large cut on his leg. The player can help the manager by finding and giving him a bandage before continuing the search for the terrace key. After helping the manager, the player must secure the key, unlock the terrace room, and win the game by diffusing the bomb.
